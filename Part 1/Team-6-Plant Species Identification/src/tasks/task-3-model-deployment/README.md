## Model Deployment

After deciding on selecting the Convolutional Neural Network for our project, we wanted to implement a way in which our model would be available for everyone to use. For this, we decided to develop a web application and deploy our machine learning model. 
For the frontend, we used vanilla HTML to structure the webpage and Vanilla CSS to style it.  The UI is kept simple and as easy to understand as possible for the comfort of the user. 
For a backend, we decided to use python’s flask framework and TensorFlow to load models for making the web application functional. 
Finally, we had with us the “TWIGSee” application. A web application that allows users upload the image of a leaf of a plant and then identify the plant’s species.

Note:
Prerequisite before using the web application: Please download the model from the following link and save it in the “functionality” folder under task 3.
