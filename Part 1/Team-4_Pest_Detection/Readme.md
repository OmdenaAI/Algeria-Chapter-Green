# **:ear_of_rice:Pest Detection (Team 4)**

It is an open source colloboration with Omdena algeria chapter. A machine learning model that predicts the presence of pests in the crop and suggests the best or requires pesticides to protect the crop. Pests are a huge threat! Farmers are hard at work however their productivity is reduced due to pests, so this model can be used to identify pests or maybe other use cases involving pest identification.

To recommend optimum pesticides to be used by farmers based on respective pests and help them make an informed decision.

## :pushpin: **DATASET** 
* The dataset reference was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simranvolunesia/pest-dataset?select=pest
* Type of Dataset: Image Dataset
* It has two folders: one is "train" and the other is "test" which is the usual bifurcation done when model has to be trained!
1. No. of training images: 300 images per pest
2. No. of testing images: 50 images per pest

* One can download the dataset which is having 10 fruits, 10 field, 10 vegetbale crops and in each category: 5 different pests.
1. Field Crops 
2. Fruit Crops 
3. Vegetable Crops
* Dataset Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yp3z1cXpFDyM4A1xdMnFopslnecw7i6R?usp=sharing

### :open_file_folder: Download and Unzip Contents from GitHub Repo

Download and unzip contents from (https://github.com/bhushanMahajan460/Pest-Detection--Final_model)

### :green_book: Generating the PKL file

The machine learning model used in this project will firstly have to be generated by successfully running the included Jupyter notebook [main.ipynb]([https://github.com/bhushanMahajan460/Pest-Detection--Final_model/blob/main/main.ipynb]). Upon successfully running all code cells, a pickle model for each ML model trained will be created that can be further used for deployment.

### You need to follow this steps to run the ipynb file

#### 1 - Make a new folder in your pc
#### 2- download/clone this repo in new folder
#### 3 - Unzip that folder
#### 4-  open jupyter notebook (make sure till you are opening jupyter from the same folder)
#### 5 - run the code
#### 6 - In data augmentation part make sure ur path is correct
#### 7 - In data augmentation part YOU NEED TO RUN ONLY ONE TIME (A CALL WHICH IS JUST AFTER DATA AUGMENTATION).


## Important -----------
#### Since there are same images in coffee crop that is why model is overfitting (IG)
#### and if we perform same model on jute dataset(which doesnt have same iimages in train dataset) then this problem will not occur, still i have used early stopping that helps in overfitting problem.

## CHANGE THE EPOCH NUMBER WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED IN 2nd CELL
