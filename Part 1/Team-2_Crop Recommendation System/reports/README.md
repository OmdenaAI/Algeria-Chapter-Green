# **CONCLUSION**
Today, machine learning in agriculture is one of the fastest-growing areas. Its applications in the farming range from simple analytics systems to complex robotics hardware. Therefore, a growing number of stakeholders are raising awareness of the potential advantages of using ML agriculture and collaborating with modern-day technologies to get reliable input data for the data analyses.
Data-driven approaches, in turn, foster better decision-making, greater efficiency, and less waste. In the coming years, weâ€™ll witness more digital agriculture with a projected market value of $4 Billion by 2026.
