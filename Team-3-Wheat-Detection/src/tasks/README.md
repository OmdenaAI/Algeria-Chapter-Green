What we are predicting? ðŸ‘€

We are attempting to predict bounding boxes around each wheat head in images that have them. If there are no wheat heads, we must predict no bounding boxes.

In this Notebook we have performed EDA on our dataset and done visualization of wheat heads in images through bounding boxes with the help of obejct detection. âœ¨
