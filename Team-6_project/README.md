# Plant Species Identification
### A Team-6 Collaboration 

Having the knowledge of identifying species of a plant is essential for protecting biodiversity. Trying to manually identify the species of a plant may be an easy task for a botanist, but to identify multiple of such plants through conventional methods becomes quite complex and time consuming. Having a system that could detect plant species automatically would not just make the task easy but time and cost effective as well. 



### What do we use to identify plant species?

To classify a plant we need to observe the plant's features.  
üå≤Structure of the plant: To obtain the structure of the plant, the image of the entire plant needs to be captured, which makes the task complex and time consuming.  
üå∏Flower: Flowers could be used to identify the species of a plant, but some plants may not be flowering plants.  
üçÇLeaf: Leaves are not seasonal and all plants have leaves, making it the perfect option to be used to identify plant species.

"TwigSee" is an application that allows user to submit an image of the leaf of a plant and the identify the plant's species. This web application was developed using Flask. 



## Dataset Used
* The Leafsnap Data set was used to develop this project.
* http://leafsnap.com/dataset/
* The dataset consists of 30,866 leaf images, 23,147 of which were pictures directly clicked from farms, the rest were pictures that were captured in a lab. 
* The pictures in the dataset belong to 185 plant species. 
* To simplify the process of development of machine learning models, we randomly selected 20 plant species to work with. These species include: 
	1. Abies Concolor
	2. Acer Rlatanoides
	3. Koelreuteria Paniculata
	4. Liquidambar Styraciflua
	5. Magnolia Soulangiana
	6. Magnolia Virginiana
	7. Malus Coronaria
	8. Metasequoia Glyptostroboides
	9. Morus Rubra
	10. Pinus Bungeana
	11. Prunus Yedoensis
	12. Quercus Acutissima
	13. Quercus Falcata
	14. Quercus Imbricaria
	15. Quercus Palustris
	16. Quercus Rubra
	17. Robinia Pseudo-acacia
	18. Sassafras Albidum
	19. Tilia Americana
	20. Ulmus Rubra
