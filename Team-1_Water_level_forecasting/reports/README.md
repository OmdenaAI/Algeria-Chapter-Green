## :nazar_amulet:  CONCLUSION
The capability of different machine learning models such as the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), CNN LSTM
was investigated for the prediction of water level at a river in Venezia , Italy. Four different input scenarios were investigated, considering correlation analysis. 
Generally, the comparison of several data-driven regression methods indicated that the exponential model offered better accuracy in predicting daily water levels with
respect to different assessment criteria. The findings of this study show the success of the our model in capturing the changes in the water level of a river; 
thus paving the way for which the model can be used in works to mitigate potential risk that may occur in the future from natural events.
